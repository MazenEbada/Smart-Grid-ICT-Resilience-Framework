To be able to work, the jar of the OPF optimizer has to be included:
1. Paste the jar into the project folder.
2. Open the "plugin.xml", open the "Runtime" tab: add the jar to the classpath (keep the "update the build path" checkbox enabled).
3. Open the "Build" tab: add the jar to the binary build
